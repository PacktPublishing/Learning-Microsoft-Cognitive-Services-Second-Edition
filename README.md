# Learning Microsoft Cognitive Services - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Learning Microsoft Cognitive Services - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-microsoft-cognitive-services-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788623025), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book will introduce you to 24 of the APIs released as part of Cognitive Services platform and show you how to leverage their capabilities. More importantly, you'll see how the power of these APIs can be combined to build real-world apps that have cognitive capabilities. The book is split into three sections: computer vision, speech recognition and language processing, and knowledge and search.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 4 and 10 does not have any code files

The code will look like the following:
```
public BitmapImage ImageSource
{
    get { return _imageSource; } 
    set
    {
        _imageSource = value;
        RaisePropertyChangedEvent("ImageSource");
    }
}
```

To follow the examples in this book you will need Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition or later. You will also need a working Internet connection and a subscription to Microsoft Azure; a trial subscriptions is OK too.

To get the full experience of the examples, you should have access to a web camera and have speakers and a microphone connected to the computer; however, neither is mandatory.
